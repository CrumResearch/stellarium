\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:plugin:Calendars:Introduction}

The calendar dates in the main program behave like most other astronomical software titles:

\begin{itemize}
\item Dates are given in the Gregorian calendar for all dates
  beginning with October 15, 1582.
\item All earlier dates are given in the Julian Calendar in its
  finalized form by Augustus. Historically, only dates beginning with
  March 1st, 4 A.D. coincide with historically recorded dates: the
  Roman priesthood messed up the 4-year count introduced by Julius
  Caesar and counted leap years every third year. Augustus decreed to
  omit leap days from 12 B.C. to 4~A.D to move the seasons to where
  Julius Caesar had placed them.
\item Given the errors in the Julian calendar, simulation in early
  prehistory will provide non-intuitive calendar dates for the
  seasons' beginnings.
\item Astronomical counting of years includes a year zero and negative
  years. Historical calendars don't have a year zero. 1~A.D. is
  preceded by 1~B.C. Therefore a negative year in Stellarium may look
  uncommon to historians who may think Stellarium is one year off.
\end{itemize}


Since earliest times people all over the world have observed the sky
and used its phenomena to record and measure time. Over millennia,
various systematic calendars evolved. A classic and often-cited
presentation of calendars from the pre-computer era is still the
monumental work by \citet{Ginzel:ChronologieI, Ginzel:ChronologieII,
  Ginzel:ChronologieIII}.  The next challenge was then to describe
the systematic of these and make them available for computer programs.
\citet{Reingold-Dershowitz:2018} have presented a modern masterpiece
of this kind and are our preferred source of algorithms. This plugin
\newFeature{v0.20.4} will evolve over the next time to bring a good
sample.

In the configuration panel you can select which calendars you want to
display in the lower right corner of the sceen.


The calendars displayed in this plugin come with their own logic:

\subsection{Lunisolar European calendars}
\begin{description}
\item[Julian] This implementation utilizes historical year counting,
  i.e., has no year zero. Years are marked A.D. or B.C., respectively.
\item[Gregorian] This implementation acts like Stellarium with respect
  to year counting and counts negative and positive years, with a year
  zero between them. It shows dates in a \emph{Proleptic Gregorian}
  calendar for dates before October 15, 1582. This may look simpler to
  keep the seasons's beginnings closer to the commonly known dates, at
  least for many more centuries in the past than the Julian calendar
  commonly used by historians.
\item[ISO Week] The International Standards Organisation describes
  weeks in the Gregorian calendar from Monday (Day 1) to Sunday (Day
  7). Week 1 of each year contains the first Thursday of the
  year. Years may have a week 53, where the last days already belong
  to the next Gregorian year.
\end{description}

\subsection{Mesoamerican calendars}
\begin{description}
\item[Maya Long Count] is a 5-part sequence of numbers. Just like most
  modern people write numbers in the decimal system (base 10), the
  Maya used base 20 as their unit. The lowest (rightmost) number runs
  from 0 to 19, the second-lowest from 0 to 17, the others from 0 to
  19 again. It is assumed the $20\times18=360$ days have been used to
  approximate the solar year.
\item[Maya Haab] is a calendar of 18 ``months'' of 20 days each, plus
  5 days (Uayeb) at the end, providing ``years'' of 365 days.
\item[Maya Tzolkin] is described as ritual calendar consisting of two
  cycles with 13 day numbers 1 to 13) and 20 names. Each day both
  counters are advanced. Date names repeat after 260 days. Usually
  both calendars were used to define a unique date which repeats only
  after a \emph{calendar round} of 52 years.
\item[Aztec Xihuitl] is similar to the Maya Haab, consisting of 18
  ``months'' of 20 days, plus 5 \emph{nemontemi} (worthless
  days). Days are counted from 1 to 20. The Aztecs may have used
  intercalation, but details have been lost. The correlation in use
  here is based on the recorded Aztec date of the fall of their empire
  to Hern\'an Cort\'es in 1521 and should provide correct dates in the
  early 16th century.
\item[Aztec Tonalpohualli] is similar in structure to the Mayan Tzolkin.
\end{description}

\subsection{Further development}
The plugin is in an early phase of development. More calendars will be added in later versions. 


\subsection{Configuration Options}
\label{sec:plugin:Calendars:configuration}

The configuration dialog allows the selection of the calendars which are
of interest to you, and also provides direct interaction with the calendars.
The Mayan and Aztec calendars allow moving to the previous or next date of that respective name. 

\subsection*{Section \big[Calendars\big] in config.ini file}

Apart from changing settings using the plugin configuration dialog,
you can also edit the \file{config.ini} file to change
settings for the Calendars plugin -- just make it carefully!
